    <p>Background of the Quit India Movement</p>
    <p>
        The Quit India Movement, also known as the August Movement or the Bharat Chhodo Andolan, was a significant milestone in India's struggle for independence against British colonial rule. It was launched by the Indian National Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi on August 8, 1942, during World War II. The movement aimed to demand an end to British rule in India and achieve full independence.

        The Quit India Movement was characterized by mass protests, civil disobedience, and nonviolent resistance against British authorities. Gandhi's call for "Do or Die" resonated throughout the country, inspiring millions of Indians from all walks of life to join the struggle for freedom. The movement saw widespread participation from students, peasants, workers, and women, showcasing the unity and determination of the Indian people in their quest for self-rule.

        Despite being met with severe repression and arrests by the British colonial government, the Quit India Movement marked a crucial phase in India's independence struggle. It galvanized the Indian masses and intensified international pressure on the British Empire to address India's aspirations for self-governance. While the movement did not immediately lead to independence, it laid the groundwork for future negotiations and paved the way for India's eventual liberation in 1947. The Quit India Movement remains a symbol of India's unwavering commitment to freedom and democracy, embodying the spirit of sacrifice and resilience that defined the struggle against colonialism.
