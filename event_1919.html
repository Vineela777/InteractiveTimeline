    The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 13, 1919, stands as one of the darkest chapters in India's struggle for independence from British rule. On that fateful day, thousands of unarmed Indian civilians, including women, children, and men, had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh public garden in Amritsar, Punjab, to peacefully protest against the oppressive Rowlatt Act imposed by the British colonial authorities. The peaceful assembly turned into a nightmare when British Indian Army troops, under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer, opened fire on the crowd without warning or provocation. The merciless shooting lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured, many of whom were shot in the back while trying to flee.

    The Jallianwala Bagh massacre shook the conscience of the nation and sent shockwaves across the world, exposing the brutality of British colonial rule in India. The atrocity galvanized the Indian freedom movement and fueled widespread outrage and condemnation both within India and internationally. Mahatma Gandhi, who later became the leader of India's independence movement, described the massacre as "an act of insane savagery" and called for nonviolent resistance against British oppression. The massacre also led to a deep sense of mistrust and resentment among Indians towards the British authorities, further intensifying the demand for self-rule and independence. The memory of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre continues to evoke feelings of sorrow, anger, and a determination to uphold the values of freedom, justice, and human rights.
