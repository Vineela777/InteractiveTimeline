    <h1>1885 - Formation of the Indian National Congress (INC)</h1>
    <p>Background of the INC's formation</p>
    <p>
        The formation of the Indian National Congress (INC) in 1885 marked a significant milestone in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. Established by prominent Indian leaders and intellectuals, including Allan Octavian Hume, Dadabhai Naoroji, and Dinshaw Wacha, the INC aimed to provide a platform for Indians to voice their political grievances and advocate for greater representation in governance. The INC's inaugural session, held in Bombay (now Mumbai), brought together representatives from different parts of India and various socio-economic backgrounds, signaling the emergence of a unified national movement against British imperialism.

        In its early years, the INC focused on advocating for Indian interests within the framework of British colonial administration, seeking constitutional reforms, and promoting social and economic progress. Key issues addressed by the Congress included demands for civil liberties, economic justice, and Indian representation in legislative bodies. Despite initial challenges and limited success in achieving its objectives, the INC played a crucial role in galvanizing nationalist sentiment across India and laying the foundation for future mass movements against British rule. Over the decades, the Congress evolved into the principal political organization leading the struggle for India's independence, with its leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the forefront of the freedom movement. The formation of the INC represented a turning point in India's political landscape, signaling the birth of a united national movement that would ultimately lead the country to freedom.
