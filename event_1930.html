    The Dandi March, also known as the Salt Satyagraha, was a pivotal event in India's struggle for independence led by Mahatma Gandhi. In 1930, Gandhi, along with a group of followers, embarked on a 240-mile journey from Sabarmati Ashram to the coastal village of Dandi in Gujarat. The objective of the march was to protest against the British salt monopoly and the imposition of salt taxes, which heavily burdened the Indian population, especially the poor.

    The Dandi March symbolized nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience against unjust colonial laws. Gandhi deliberately chose salt as the focal point of the protest because it was a commodity of daily use, and the British salt laws were seen as a glaring example of British exploitation. Despite facing opposition and arrest threats from the British authorities, Gandhi and his followers walked peacefully, engaging with villagers along the way, spreading the message of self-reliance and nonviolent resistance.
