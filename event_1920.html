        The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, stands as one of the most significant chapters in India's struggle for independence. It marked a departure from traditional methods of protest, advocating nonviolent resistance and mass civil disobedience against British rule. The movement aimed to unite Indians across caste, creed, and class lines, fostering a spirit of unity and collective action in pursuit of freedom.

        Under Gandhi's leadership, the Non-Cooperation Movement sought to mobilize the masses in a peaceful yet powerful manner. It called for Indians to boycott British institutions, including schools, courts, and government offices, and to refuse to buy British goods. The movement also encouraged the adoption of indigenous products and the promotion of cottage industries, emphasizing self-reliance and economic empowerment. Despite its eventual suspension following the violence at Chauri Chaura in 1922, the Non-Cooperation Movement left an indelible mark on India's consciousness, inspiring future generations in their quest for independence and social justice.
